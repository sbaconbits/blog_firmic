3D Printed T12 soldering iron tip holder.

<!--more-->

I have recently bought a new soldering iron, it's my first cartridge style iron and i'm really impressed with its performance. There are plenty of reviews online of this soldering iron, just search for "stm32 t12". I went for the KSGER version as it seems to be made to a high standard. Here is a picture of it:

I bought it from [aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/KSGER-Soldering-Station-DIY-Kit-STM32-2-1S-OLED-1-3-Display-Temperature-Controller-Digital-Electronic/32820505482.html).

The only problem i've had with it is the aluminium handle version that I got had a bit of a tolerance related problem and needed a bit of fiddling with until it made a reliable connection with the cartridge. 

Now that I have a new iron with loads of tips I need somewhere to put them, another excuse to 3D print something. I started off by modelling the tip and arranged some of them in the positions that I want them to be held. The next stage was to draw a profile to revolve to make a circular holder as you can see in the image below:

Once the profile has been revolved and the tips have been subtracted, the model looks like this:

This is how it looks with the tips inserted in the model:

After a bit of printing this is the result, a crown worthy of the new soldering iron:
